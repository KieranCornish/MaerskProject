#Maersk BlazeDemo

# <i>The Task: <I>
 The website has a flight ticket booking functionality. Can book a flight as any other flight booking website by searching available flight using the source and destination and then finalising the booking by entering the passenger details.
    The task was to create an automated test to verify that the booking functionality and verify the confirmation id.
  

#Prerequisites
In Order to run the project and access the project tests you will need to download intellij from this link
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
after installing Intellij there are a few plugins you will need to install on intellij itself such as cucumber for java and Gherkin.

After this you are ready to run the project as long as you have it downloaded and open in in intellij.
#Highlights
In order to complete this project there where a few blockers before attempting the task, due to the laptop not having the correct software installed. 
But i felt although this was a major set back I achieved a lot in the time I had.


My test framework is scalable and maintainable and laid out in a way in which makes it easy to come back to a reuse, I am happy with my test coverage and with more time im confident i would have achieved wider coverage.  

#Improvements
If i was to attempt this project again I would have had the correct software pre installed to allow me more time to complete the project.
which would allow me to complete my gherkin and create my stepdefs, which i was unfortunately unable to complete.
I would also use a windows pc as I wasn't used to using a mac but that is a small adjustment to make which sadly still hindered the project but I didn't let it faze me.

#Bugs 
When testing the site despite the most functions working properly the site didnt take the information that I input into the form into consideration.

Another bug which I realised was the data never changed despite the information or options you entered.
